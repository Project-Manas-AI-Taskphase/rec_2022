# Recruitments 2022
This organisation's sole purpose is to upload code for your finished tasks. Below are the instructions to use this organisation.

## Making your own repo
If you are here for the first time then create a new **private repo** using your name, for example if your name is "Darth Vader" then use keep the repo name as `darth_vader`. 

## Uploading Code
Once done setting up the repo, you can now move on to upload your code. For doing so first clone the repo under your name, and then create a folder for the task, for example if the task name is "Linear Regression" then use the folder name `linear_regression`.

For each task only upload only the relevant files. 
For ex: 
- for the ros task upload the contents of `src` but not the `build`, `devel` and `log` folders.
- for the ml / opencv tasks, upload all the `.ipynb` files you use
